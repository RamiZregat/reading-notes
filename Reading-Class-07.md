# REST and API Keys

## REST 
 
**- Who is Roy Fielding?**  

A guy who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

**- Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**  |

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

**- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**\

it is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.  

**- What does a GET do?**

GET is used to request data from a specified resource.

**-What does a POST do?**

POST is used when one system needs to add something to another system.

**-What does PUT do?**

Put is used when a system wants to replace something in another system.

**- What does PATCH do?**

Patch is used when to do a partial update to the system.


## API Keys

**- What is API Keys?**

The API key is a unique identifier that authenticates requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes. You must have at least one API key associated with your project.

**- What the use of API Keys?**

API keys are used to track and control how the API is being used, for example to prevent malicious use or abuse of the API. The API key often acts as both a unique identifier and a secret token for authentication, and is assigned a set of access that is specific to the identity that is associated with it.
