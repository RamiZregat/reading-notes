# Markdown

**Markdown** is a coding language but its more simple and easy than the *HTML*, its from the best choices out there to learn for new people on the field of programming and coding.

I learned how to use **markdown** on github and now i can use markdown to style webpages with bold, italic and strikethrough words and sentences, also i learned how to add headings, links, images and more.

simply its coding with simple ways as example if u want to make headings all you gotta do is type # and follow it with your header text but in *HTML* u had to type \<h1>your header\</h1> so its easier to use than *HTML*.
