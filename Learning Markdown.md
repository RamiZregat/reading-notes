# Markdown

**Markdown** is a coding language but its more simple and easy than the *HTML*, its from the best choices out there to learn for new people on the field of programming and coding,  and it has additional features.

There is a *flavored Markdown* language its same **Markdown** language but with different version some sites uses the *flavored markdown* such as [**Github**](https://github.com/).

I learned how to use **markdown** on **Github** and now i can use markdown to style webpages with bold, italic and strikethrough words and sentences, also i learned how to add headings, links, images and more.

simply its coding with simple ways as example:

if u want to make heading all you have to do is to type
```
# your heading text
```

but in html you have to type 
```
<h1>your heading text</h1>
```
so its easier to use **Markdown** than *HTML*.
