# Solve Programming Problems

**- How to Solve Programming Problems:** 
When most programmers are given a programming problem in an interview, they make several key mistakes.  The most severe of those is the improper allocation of time.  

If you have heard the saying “measure twice and cut once,” then you are probably familiar with the idea of spending upfront time to make sure something is done right, rather than diving right in.  

The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.
You must resist this urge.  

You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.    

Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration, Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

**- Simple set of steps to solve problems:**  
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.


     
# Act like you make $1000/hr

- many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission.  

- The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.  

- They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take.  

- They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective.

- See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck.

- If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.  

- This is how lives are wasted — by doing thankless work for ungrateful takers that didn’t deserve your time in the first place.  

- We’re all busy — with work, our families, our friends. It’s not bad to be “busy.” But in the words of best-selling author Jeff Goins:  

`“The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”`


# How to think like a programmer

**- You probably also wondered what does it mean, exactly, to think like a programmer? And how do you do it??** 

 - Essentially, it’s all about a more effective way for problem solving.

**- Why is problem solving important?**  

- Problem solving is the meta-skill.  

- We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.  

- Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.  

- Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.  

- Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.

# The 5 Whys

**- How to Use the 5 Whys:**

1. **Assemble a Team:** 
- Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2. **Define the Problem:** 
- If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets" or "Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures."  

3. **Ask the First "Why?"** 
- Ask your team why the problem is occurring. (For example, "Why isn't Team A meeting its response time targets?")

- Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

- This prevents 5 Whys from becoming just a process of deductive reasoning, which can generate a large number of possible causes and, sometimes, create more confusion as you chase down hypothetical problems.

4. **Ask "Why?" Four More Times:** 
- For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded. 

5. **Know When to Stop:** 
- You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident. (As we said earlier, if you're not sure that you've uncovered the real root cause, consider using a more in-depth problem-solving technique like Cause and Effect Analysis , Root Cause Analysis , or FMEA .)

6. **Address the Root Cause(s):**
 - Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

 7. **Monitor Your Measures:**
 - Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
