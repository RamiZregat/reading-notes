# Version Control
**Version control**: known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software .

## There is three types of version control:
1. **Local Version Control System.**
2. **Centralized Version Control System.**
3. **Distributed Version Control System.**


- ### Local Version Control System:
A local version control system is a local database located on your local computer, in which every file change is stored as a patch. Every patch set contains only the changes made to the file since its last version.

- ### Centralized Version Control System:
A centralized version control system has a single server that contains all the file versions. This enables multiple clients to simultaneously access files on the server, pull them to their local computer or push them onto the server from their local computer. This way, everyone usually knows what everyone else on the project is doing. Administrators have control over who can do what.

- ### Distributed Version Control System:
With distributed version control systems, clients donâ€™t just check out the latest snapshot of the files from the server, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, everyone collaborating on a project owns a local copy of the whole project, i.e. owns their own local database with their own complete history.
