# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions
## HTML Tables
**- HTML Tables:** 
* The `<table>` *HTML* element represents tabular data â€” that is, information presented in a two-dimensional **table** comprised of **rows** and **columns** of cells containing data.

* Each **table** may have an associated caption that provides a short description of the **table's** purpose.

* Sytnax for the table:
```
<table>
        <tr>
            <th>The table header1</th>
            <th>The table header2</th>
        </tr>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>The table body</td>
            <td>with two columns</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

* It would look like this :

The table header1|The table header2
---------|----------
The table body | with two columns

* The `<table>` tag defines an *HTML* table.
* Each table row is defined with a `<tr>` tag. Each table header is defined with a `<th>` tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a `<td>` tag.
* By default, the text in `<th>` elements are bold and centered.
* By default, the text in `<td>` elements are regular and left-aligned.
