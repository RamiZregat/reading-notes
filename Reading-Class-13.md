# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

**- What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?**  
the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.

**- Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**
it matters because they have the basic computer skills and maybe even more than basic skills, which put them in ahead start on the females.  



## Employee breakdown of key technology companies


**- What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?**
* almost all companies has no diversity  in races (white/black) as example look at HP company it has 73% of their employees white.
* The diversity is still not accurate the ratio of males more than females in the companys.
* but in US there is more females than males.


## Why diversity matters to your tech company

**-When are diversity efforts most successful?**  
Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. At Paradigm, we spend a lot of time brainstorming with CEOs and other company leaders about what is or should be driving their diversity and inclusion efforts.


**- Why do diverse companies perform better?**  
because diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.


**-Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**  
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
