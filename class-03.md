# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow
## HTML Lists

**- HTML Lists:** *HTML* lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.

**-** There is three type of **HTML** lists: An **Unordered HTML list**, an **Ordered HTML list** and **Definition HTML lists**.

**-** Unordered *HTML* list it will be written in *HTML* as shown below:
```
<ul>
  <li>item</li>
  <li>item</li>
  <li>item</li>
</ul>  
```
it will be shown as below:

* item
* item
* item

**-** Ordered *HTML* list it will be written in *HTML* as shown below:
```
<ol>
  <li>item</li>
  <li>item</li>
  <li>item</li>
</ol> 
```
it will be shown as below:
1. item 
2. item 
3. item

## CSS Boxes

**- CSS Boxes:** All *HTML* elements can be considered as **boxes**.
In **CSS**, the term *"box model"* is used when talking about design and layout.
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

**-** Explanation of the different parts:

* Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear.  
* Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.  
* Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.  
* Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.  

**-** The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 

## JS Control Flow

**- what is Control Flow:** The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. 

**-** Code is runing in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

**-** A typical script in JavaScript includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.

**-** Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
