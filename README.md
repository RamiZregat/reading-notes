**Growth Mindset** is the development of fundamental abilities and its allows you to proceed further towards your goals, it allow you to foucs more on proceeding your skills more than challenging others and feel bad about your self when u fail.

### There is some reminders to keep yourself in a growth mindset :

At the end i would say everyone should have a growth mindset to get to his goals and the ~~fixed mindset~~ should not be existed in your life, and as I say `The result is irrelevant because the effort was there.`

Good luck in your life and keep being positive.
