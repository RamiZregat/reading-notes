# Operators and Loops

## Loops
* **Loops:** *Loops* offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.


* You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:
 ```
for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}
 ```


* There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times, some of this kinds are the **(For statement)** and the **(While statement)**.


* The typical form for the **(For statement)** as follow:
 ```
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement
  ```

  * The typical form for the **(While statement)** as follow:
  ```
while (condition)
  statement
  ```

## Operators

* **Operators:** In computer programming, *operators* are constructs defined within programming languages which behave generally like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically.


* **JavaScript** has the following types of *operators*:   
**\-** Assignment operators.  
**\-** Comparison operators.  
**\-** Arithmetic operators.  
**\-** Bitwise operators.  
**\-** Logical operators.  
**\-** String operators.  
**\-** Conditional (ternary) operator.   
**\-** Comma operator.  
**\-** Unary operators.
**\-** Relational operators.
