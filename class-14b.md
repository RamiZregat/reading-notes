# What Google Learned About Teams

## Introduction:
* Put five, eight, 12 or more people together in a room, and it’s a crapshoot as to how well they’ll function as a team. The larger the group, the more difficult it becomes.

* Shared-interest is the lifeblood of teams, and only the most successful companies know how to foster it.

## Google:
* That’s exactly what Google wanted to learn in 2012, when it embarked on a quest to discover how to build the “perfect team.” The experiment, led by Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division, was called “Project Aristotle.”

* After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across the company, Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual personalities) in a team are not so relevant.

* Dubey said in an interview with The New York Times: “We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter,”

* Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:
1. **Psychological safety:** Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.

2. **Dependability:** Everyone completes quality work on time.

3. **Structure and clarity:** Everyone knows what their specific expectations are, these expectations must be challenging yet attainable.

4. **Meaning:** Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).

5. **Impact:** Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.

## Researchers

* **Not all researchers agree:** While Google’s findings may be true to some extent, a large number of scientific studies have caused researchers (outside of Google’s lab) to shockingly disagree. They claim the exact opposite — that personality, not just skills, is indeed a significant factor in what makes a team successful.

* Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor of business psychology at Columbia University and author of the book “Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders? (and How to Fix It),” and psychologist Dave Winsborough, former VP at Hogan Assessment Systems, argue personality, in particular, heavily affects the role of an individual within a team.
